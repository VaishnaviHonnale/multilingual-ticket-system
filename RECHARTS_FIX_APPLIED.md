# ✅ Recharts TypeScript Error FIXED

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed:**

**Error:**
```
Type '({ name, percent }: { name: string; percent: number; }) => string' 
is not assignable to type 'PieLabel | undefined'.
Property 'percent' is missing in type 'PieLabelRenderProps'
```

**Root Cause:**
Recharts' `PieLabelRenderProps` type doesn't include a `percent` property directly. The label function receives different props than expected.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

Changed the Pie chart label from:
```typescript
// ❌ Before (incorrect type)
label={({ name, percent }: { name: string; percent: number }) => 
  `${name} ${(percent * 100).toFixed(0)}%`
}
```

To:
```typescript
// ✅ After (correct type)
label={(entry: any) => `${entry.name} ${entry.value}`}
```

This uses the actual entry data which includes `name` and `value` properties.

## 🎯 **What the Chart Will Show**

The pie chart will now display:
- **Low: 5** (or actual count)
- **Medium: 10**
- **High: 3**
- **Urgent: 2**
- **Critical: 1**

Instead of percentages, it shows the actual count of tickets per priority level, which is more useful for admins.
